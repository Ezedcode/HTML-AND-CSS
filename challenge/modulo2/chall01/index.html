        <h2>The first version</h2>
          
        <p>The first attempt to create a mascot arose at 2007 and comes by a developer called <a href="https://androidcommunity.com/dan-morrill-shows-us-the-android-mascot-that-almost-was-20130103/" target="_blank" class="external">Dan Morrill</a>. he tells that he open the <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank" class="external">Inkscape</a>(free software for image vectorization) and created your own robot version. the goal was just to personify the system just for your team, no request company to create a mascot.</p>

        <p>This first bizarre version was named in tribute of your creator: would be the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.</p>
                      
        <h2>A new mascot appears</h2>
        
        <p>The idea of having a mascot was maturing and the mission was passed for a professional in the field. The illustrator <a href="https://www.irinablok.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Irina Block</a>, also Google employees, stayed with the mission to represent the little robot in more pleasant way.</p>

        <p>Irene's main idea was to represent all graphically with few traces and in a flatter way. The drawing also should generate quick identification with who looks at he. So appears the <strong>Bugdroid</strong> the new mascot of Android.</p>
                
        <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" class="small" alt="Bugdroids">

        <p>The main inspiration for the traces of the new <strong>Bugdroid</strong> came from that toy that illustrate bathroom doors for indicate the general of each door. Tells the legend that the artist was creating on your table at the desk's <strong>Google</strong> and looks for the side of bathroom and the identification was immediate: simple, clear, objective.</p>
